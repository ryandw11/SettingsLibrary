How to use:
1. Put the KeyHandler script on the main camera.
2. Put the ButtonScript on the button you want to be a keybutton.
3. Set the name variable of the script.
4. Set the default key.
5. On the button click events add the button script to it and call onClick();

It is now set up.

To access the key settings just get the KeyHandler by doing the following:

KeyHandler kh = Camera.main.gameObject.getComponenet<KeyHandler>();
KeyCode k = kh.getKey("name");
